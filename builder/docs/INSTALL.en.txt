1. Open etc/jnode.xxx.conf and change your configuration as described.

2. Run bin/run.sh if you are running on Linux/FreeBSD/OS X or bin\run.bat if on Windows.

3. At the first run, jNode will add some entries to database. Look for messages and don't miss your technical point info!
 For example: 
    18-01-2014 17:45:29 [00000001] InstallUtil          [+] owner point account created
    18-01-2014 17:45:29 [00000001] InstallUtil
	FTN: 2:9999/9999.1
	Aka: Rodriguez bender
	Password: 7e3fb3d2

4. Use data you got in previous step to config your point system. It's easy!
Keep in mind that jNode is a server-side software and it don't provides any UI for message handling.

5. You will find a netmail to your technical point with account to use web control panel.
Usualy it is located at http://127.0.0.1:8080/secure/index.html

6. Log in and configure your node.

7. Enjoy and keep you software updated.
